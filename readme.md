# Readme

These scripts contain Seurat analysis for the publication "Single-cell transcriptomics provides insights into hypertrophic cardiomyopathy" by Wehrens et al. published in Cell Reports (2022), DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110809](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110809).

# Rdata & Seurat data files 

There are Rdata and h5seurat files that contain the backbone processed data of this analysis.
I'll be looking to put those online somewhere too, but currently haven't done that yet.
Contact me (m.wehrens@hubrecht.eu) if you would like to take a look at the data using these files.

# About the scripts
